## Features

* **Searchable events:** press Ctrl+F and find the event you're looking for and the app will center the view on it.
* **Integrated web-browser:** Save links to an event and view them inside the application. You can even specify the type of the link and, for example, if it's an audio it will play in the background.
* **Conditional view**: You can add named conditions (like "Composers", "Painters", etc) and select at any time which events you want to see. This is powered by conditional expressions syntax parsing so you can for example add an event for Beethoven and use the condition expression: __Composers && (ComposersClassical || ComposersRomantic)__
* **Embedded help:** press F1 at any time for a window which contains all the information you need. No need to open external PDF's.
* **XML Saves:** all the save data is stored in UTF-8 XML files that can be parsed by other apps for all kinds of statistics (plus it's human readable).

## Future

- [ ] **3D Visualization:** 3D view of the timeline. __Easter egg!__ Actually you can peek an prototype pressing ctrl+3 after loading your timeline. Click and drag to move the view. F10 and F11 to zoom (use ctrl to change the size of the zoom steps)
